description: Meetup at KM talking about drone parts printed.
---

For this month's `Knox3dp` meetup, John Love will talk about how he got interested in 3d printing, and detail some projects he has done recently in printing drone components for quadcopter and hexacopter applications. The talk will have a good mix of 3d printing experience and some insight into the electronics that keep drones in the air. In addition, we'll have several members from Knoxville's FPV community - a group in Knoxville of first person video drone operators who compete with extremely lightweight drones - who can share both failures and successes in using 3d printing for their lightweight parts.
